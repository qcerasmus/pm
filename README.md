## PM
pm is a terminal interface password manager. It uses encryption with a unique passphrase which is prompted for before the GUI loads.
All of the passwords are saved to a file which makes it pretty easy to share accross devices.

### IMPORTANT!
Do not use this! It uses XXTEA for encryption and decryption which is broken. Please do not use this.
